            I build tools that genuinely make people&apos;s lives easier â€” always with empathy, strategic thinking, and a sprinkle of magic (or, as others might call it: low-code and AI).
          </p>

          <p>
            With a background in Mechanical Engineering and a specialization in Product Design Management, I blend technical precision with creative intuition to craft products people actually enjoy using. Whether it&apos;s designing internal tools or building seamless B2B solutions, my sweet spot is translating complex problems into beautifully simple, intuitive experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I work as a Product Developer within a Data Science department, where I design tools for data intake, task automation, and decision-making. From cleaning and transforming messy data to automating tedious processes, I create systems that allow teams to analyze, act, and even predict â€” faster and smarter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the past 3+ years, I&apos;ve delivered digital products using no-code/low-code platforms across HR tech, logistics, education, and even nursery snack tracking (priorities!). I apply AI thoughtfully â€” automating what doesn&apos;t need a human touch, so people can focus on what does.
          </p>

          <p>
            My mission is simple: solve real-world problems with tools that feel effortless, elegant, and refreshingly human.
